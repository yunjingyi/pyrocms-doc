## Download PyroCMS

Once you have an environment that meets {{ link uri="reference/server-requirements" title="the requirements" }}, you'll need to <a href="http://pyrocms.com/get">download PyroCMS</a>.

If you are familiar with [git](http://git-scm.com/), you can clone a copy of the repository from our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms) page:

    git clone -o pyrocms https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms -b 2.2/master

Make sure you are using the correct branch - the {{ link title="PyroCMS versions guide" uri="reference/pyrocms-versions" }} explains the difference between branches.

## Open the Installer

Download and extract the PyroCMS files into your development folder of choice. Next, visit the URL where your install is. For example, if we extracted PyroCMS into a folder called <strong>pyro</strong> on our development environment, we'd visit:

    http://localhost/pyro/

The installer will load an walk you throught the necessary steps to install PyroCMS.

Once it's done, you'll have a link to your PyroCMS site as well as the admin area so you can log in. The admin panel is always located at /admin, in our **pyro** folder example, you can find your admin panel at:

    http://localhost/pyro/admin

<div class="note"><p>Once you log into your admin panel for the first time, PyroCMS may prompt you to delete your installation folder if it wasn't able to do so autmoatically. <strong>It's very important to delete your install folder!</strong></p></div>

Go ahead and log into PyroCMS for the first time with the account you created during the installation process. You're now ready to get started!
