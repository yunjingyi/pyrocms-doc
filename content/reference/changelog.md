## 2.1.3 - August 9, 2012

### Improvements

* Made Page Chunks use sections and id + classes. Before page chunks were getting a bit div happy and that made me sad. Now each chunk is a section, with id="{{ noparse }}{{ slug }}{{ /noparse }}" and a new box has been created for classes. This will allow much more flexible content, with more semantic meaning.
* Improved user registration. User registration was confusing as it either sent activation emails or let users register freely. Now it either sends an activation email or it waits for an admin to activate (like it said it was doing before but actually didn't). Additionally when creating users from the admin panel you can set them as Inactive, Active, or Send Activation Email and let them activate. You can also send the activation email later when editing a user

* Fixes #1646 and #1665. Keywords were not working with latin characters. Thanks @stewones
